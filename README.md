## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. **Data**
- Located in the `data` folder.
- Excludes the raw data and intermediate data due to size, please contact me if you wish to have them
- Includes the preprocessed and application datasets.
- The workflow starts with the source data and progresses through intermediate, preprocessed, and final application stages.

### 2. **Code**
The codebase is organized into the following key folders:

#### **Preprocessing**
Contains three Jupyter notebooks:
- **`source.ipynb`**: Handles data loading and sampling.  
- **`preprocess.ipynb`**: Includes data subsetting, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and utility matrix construction.  
- **`clustering.ipynb`**: Performs clustering analysis on the normalized utility matrix.

#### **Application**
Contains two Jupyter notebooks for applying recommendation algorithms:
- **`cosine_similarity.ipynb`**: Implements cosine similarity on the utility matrix.  
- **`matrix_factorization.ipynb`**: Implements matrix factorization on the utility matrix.

#### **Helpers**
- Contains styling functions and plot utilities to enhance visualizations and readability.
